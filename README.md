The latest version of the game is hosted at: 

https://s3vans.github.io/summer23/

Or, to host it locally at https://localhost:8000, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/s3vans/summer23.git
cd summer23

# Start a webserver with either:
python -m SimpleHTTPWebserver   # python2.7
# OR:
python -m http.server           # python3
```

We are rewriting the game from scratch after making this prototype last summer
