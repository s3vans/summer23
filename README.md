# POKEMON VS TEAM ROCKET

## Overview

This is a Pokemon-themed castle-defender game modeled after "Plants vs.
Zombies".

It consists of 5 levels in which various attackers attack from the right with
the goal of reaching the left side of the screen. The player starts the level
with an amount of XP displayed in the top-right of the screen. The player can
click on falling collectibles to increase their XP. The player spends XP to buy
and place defenders in the way of the attackers. The defenders launch
projectiles of various strengths. The attackers can hit the defender only when
next to them. Defenders and attackers have HP that represents their health.

The game can be played on a touch screen but there are some keyboard shortcuts
